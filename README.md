You are an intrepid spy sent to capture important enemy secrets! Use the arrow keys to navigate to the enemy base (bottom right) and steal their flag. Bring the flag back to home base to score a point. Watch out - the enemies will get faster as your point count increases.

Uses JavaScript, Canvas, HTML, and CSS.
